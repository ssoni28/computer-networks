PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM:
It takes one command line parameter (a URL), downloads the associated 
web page and saves it to the current directory using raw sockets

HIGH LEVEL APPROACH:
The program is developed with python. Socket library is used to identify the 
IP Address of source and destination machines. It is also used to create, send 
and receive via raw Sockets. 

Timeout Functionality:
To handle Acknowledgement delay and validate live communication, 
settimeout functionality of socket library is used

IP Implementation:
IP header is constructed along with the checksum
Incoming IP Packets are verified using their checksum
Header is packed in network order using struct library of python

TCP Implementation:
Three Way Connection Handshake and Connection Teardown is implemented
Random Port and Sequence numbers are used to avoid Connection Confusion 
and Security Issues.Header and Data are packed in network order using 
struct library of python.Pseudo Header is calculated for verifying 
incoming TCP checksum.Incoming Packets are ordered and duplicates are
handled using pythonâ€™s OrderedDictinary 

Html Parsing:
The Ordered Data packets are parsed using HTTP Response packet and 
content of the response is stored in the output file

CHALLENGES FACED:
Pseudo Header Calculation was the challenging task. Used the message format 
to build the header for verifying incoming packets. Source IP identification 
of host machine is done using creating a socket connection 

TESTING:
Tested using the FakeBook server and stress tested using large files of size 2Mb, 
10Mb and 50MB. The output files are verified using md5sum utility of Linux
